- using vanilla css, but incorporating material design principles
- implement preliminary ui/basic styling
- incorporate modals

- adding ability to click on event with modal popping up:
    - design modal completely first!!
    - style modal - look at notes and plan fields
    -> button to close modal : left off: cant exit modal. cant animate exit!


- redux:
    - set up redux
    -> consider disabling edit mode for rest when a modal is open
    -  have entered text stored in state and rendered
    - set up user flow (login as user, load events, edit,logout)

- next to tackle:
    - responsiveness
    - adding couple of things to backend ( count in vacation days tag )
    - connect backend with login

- side hustle visual improvements:
    - buttons: hover/on click effects
    - days: hover/on click effects
    - modal pop-up animation
    - header: make white with colored text and buttons
    - font analysis/adjustment
    - alter shadow and table spacing
